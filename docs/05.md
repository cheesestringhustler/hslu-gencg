## Faces

For faces I wasn't quite sure what to do. I was intrested in using the webcam to track face features but no idea what to do with those coordinates.

With some input from Guillaume and some other artists I experimented replicating faces from Bruno Murani <img src="../content/day05/images/BrunoMunariBook.jpeg" width="150"/> <img src="../content/day05/images/BrunoMunariSketch.jpeg" width="150"/> <br>
I settled on this rather geometric style, which was fun connecting the face landmarks to generate lines.
