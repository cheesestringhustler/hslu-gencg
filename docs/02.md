## Iterative Patterns

### Paper Sketch

For the sketch I went with a simple grid, which I imagined to be made of cubes.

### Code

Firstly I started trying to implement the sketch in three.js but for my simple purposes I felt quite overwhelmed having to work with <a href="https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine/blob/master/README.md">MeshGeometry</a> just to change lineWidth.

{% endraw %}

So I went with P5.js for now. Adding a rotation to the cubes where every cube should have a diffrent rotation (0-360). Additionally I mapped a color parameter to the rotation.

### Further

After some quick googling I found a bash version of the Commodore 10Print command with following results.
